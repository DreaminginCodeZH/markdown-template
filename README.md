# Markdown template

Zhang Hai's markdown template, using [Apollo theme](https://github.com/sanographix/tumblr/tree/master/apollo) modified from [hexo-theme-apollo](https://github.com/joyceim/hexo-theme-apollo), pangu.js from [paranoid-auto-spacing](https://github.com/vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing) for automatic spacing between full-width and half-width letters, and [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) for TeX rendering.

Currently I use Chrome print to file for rendering.

## Get Started

Execute `deploy.sh` to generate a template for your own use, and then start writing your markdown documents from the template.

You can also optionally execute `install.sh` to install the template file to your XDG template directory, for usage within most file managers.
